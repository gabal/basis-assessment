# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Run tests

Running tests will automatically excecute code coverage

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
```

## Possible Improvements
 - Implement SSR on Dashboard passing the search parameters from page
 - Improve design allowing better behavior using mobile first strategy (currently it is only flexible design)
 - Increase code coverage
 - Show a default image for movie posters not found
 - Add skeleton loader to simulate fast response while loading and searching
 - Memoize results based on query parameter for search
